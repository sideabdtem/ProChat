## Navigation Flow

```
SplashScreen (checks auth)
├── No User → GuestMainNavigation (2 tabs)
│   ├── Home
│   └── Sign In/Up → AuthScreen → Role-based navigation
├── Client → MainNavigation (4 tabs)
│   ├── Home → Inner pages
│   ├── Sessions History
│   ├── Notifications  
│   └── Profile/Settings (tabbed)
└── Expert → ExpertNavigation (5 tabs)
    ├── Home → Inner pages
    ├── Dashboard
    ├── Sessions
    ├── Business
    └── Settings
```

## Back Button Behavior

- **Main tab (index 0)**: Show exit dialog
- **Other main tabs**: Navigate to home tab
- **Inner pages**: Normal back navigation
- **Auth screen**: Return to guest navigation

## Benefits Achieved

1. ✅ Consistent navigation across all user roles
2. ✅ Proper back button handling
3. ✅ Centralized navigation state management
4. ✅ Clean separation between guest, client, and expert flows
5. ✅ Session persistence across app restarts
6. ✅ Seamless inner page navigation

## Notes

- All navigation screens properly use WillPopScope for back button handling
- NavigationManager is a singleton for consistent state
- Inner page navigation maintains bottom navigation visibility
- Profile and Settings combined into one tab with TabView for clients
- Experts can browse other experts through their Home tab
